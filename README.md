# Physics Simulation Lab

A collection of interactive physics simulations built with React, TypeScript, and p5.js.

## Available Simulations

### 1. Collision Simulator
Explore elastic collisions between objects of different masses and visualize conservation of momentum and energy.

### 2. Double Pendulum Chaos
Witness the fascinating chaotic behavior of a double pendulum system. Adjust initial conditions and physical parameters to explore how small changes can lead to dramatically different outcomes.

#### Features:
- Real-time physics simulation using Lagrangian mechanics
- Adjustable initial conditions (angles and angular velocities)
- Customizable physical parameters (masses, lengths, gravity, damping)
- Visual trail of the second pendulum bob
- Phase space visualization
- Energy conservation monitoring
- Time scale control
- Interactive controls with immediate feedback
